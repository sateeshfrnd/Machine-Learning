# Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on the relationship with one or more independent variables.

### What is Linear Regression?
Linear Regression models the relationship between:
- **Dependent Variable (y)**: The variable we want to predict.
- **Independent Variable(s) (x)**: The features we use for prediction.

The model assumes that the relationship between (x) and (y) is linear.

The mathematical representation is:

Where:
- y : Predicted value.

: Intercept (value of \(y\) when \(x = 0\)).

 : Coefficient/slope (rate of change of \(y\) with \(x\)).
- x : Independent variable (feature).

: Error/residual (difference between actual and predicted \(y\)).


### Types of Linear Regression
1. **Simple Linear Regression**:
   - One independent variable.
   - Example: Predicting weight based on height.
2. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
   - Multiple independent variables.
   - Example: Predicting house price based on size, location, and number of rooms.
