# Machine-Learning

## Definition of Machine Learning
Machine learns patterns from the data and tries to replicate the same in future.

## Types of Machine Learning
Machine learning techniques can be broadly categorized into three main types:
1. Supervised Learning :
   - ML style where the dependent variable is present and having historical data.
   - in SL, learn from labeled data, where the algorithm learns to map input data to known output labels.
   - The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels.
2. Unsupervised Learning :
   - ML style where the dependent variable is not present and no historical data. Helps yo find similar groups in the data.
   - Work with unlabeled data, where the algorithm tries to find patterns or structure from unlabeled data.
3. Semi-Supervised Learning :
   - It's combination of the Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
   - Both labelled and unlaballed data avilable in data.
4. Reinforcement Learning :
   - An agent interacts with an environment and watches the result of interaction
   - Environment gives feedback via positive or nagative reward signal.
   - Focus on learning through interaction with an environment to achieve a goal. The algorithm learns to take actions to maximize cumulative reward.

## Types of Supervised Learning Problems

1. **Classification**:
   - In classification problems, the output variable is categorical, and the goal is to assign input instances to one of several predefined classes or categories.
   - Example applications include Email Spam Detection, Sentiment Analysis, Image Classification, and Medical Diagnosis.

2. **Regression**:
   - In regression problems, the output variable is continuous, and the goal is to predict a numerical value or quantity.
   - Example applications include House Price Prediction, Stock Price Forecasting, and Demand Forecasting.

## Machine Learning Model
Machine learning models are trained on labeled data (supervised learning) or unlabeled data (unsupervised learning) to learn patterns and relationships, which can then be applied to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.
