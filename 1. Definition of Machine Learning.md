# Definition of Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed to do so. In essence, machine learning algorithms allow computers to recognize patterns and learn from experience, improving their performance over time.

**In simple, Machine learns patterns from the data and tries to replicate the same in future**

*The subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. - Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer.*

The key components of machine learning include:

1. **Data**: Machine learning algorithms require a large amount of data to learn from. This data can be labeled (with known outcomes) or unlabeled (without known outcomes).

2. **Features**: Features are specific characteristics or attributes of the data that are used as input for the machine learning algorithm. The selection and engineering of relevant features play a crucial role in the performance of the algorithm.

3. **Models**: Machine learning models are mathematical representations of patterns found in the data. These models are trained on the available data to learn the underlying relationships and make predictions or decisions.

4. **Training**: During the training phase, the machine learning algorithm is exposed to the labeled data and adjusts its internal parameters to minimize errors or discrepancies between its predictions and the actual outcomes.

5. **Inference**: Once trained, the machine learning model can be used to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. This process is known as inference and is the primary goal of deploying machine learning systems in real-world applications.

6. **Evaluation**: It's essential to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. This involves testing the model on a separate dataset (validation or test set) and measuring its accuracy or other relevant metrics.

Machine learning techniques can be broadly categorized into three main types:

- **Supervised Learning**: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, where each example is associated with a target outcome. The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels.
  
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Unsupervised learning involves learning patterns and structures from unlabeled data. The algorithm seeks to identify inherent relationships or groupings within the data without explicit guidance.
  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, allowing it to learn the optimal behavior through trial and error.

Overall, machine learning enables computers to extract valuable insights from data, automate decision-making processes, and improve efficiency across a wide range of applications and industries.
